Create a database called "my_first_db": 
use my_first_db(This creates the database if it doesn't exist already).

Create students collection: 
db.createCollection("student").

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: 
({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})

Create 5 students with the appropriate info: 
db.students.insert({name: "James", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 12, day: 12, year: 2000}})
db.students.insert({name: "Carlos", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 12, day: 12, year: 2000}})
db.students.insert({name: "George", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 6, birthday: {month: 3, day: 6, year: 1989}})
db.students.insert({name: "Justin", home_state: "Oklahoma", lucky_number: 12, birthday: {month: 8, day: 12, year: 1995}})
db.students.insert({name: "Joan", home_state: "Tennessee", lucky_number: 8, birthday: {month: 6, day: 5, year: 1986}})



Get all students: 
db.students.find({}) or db.students.find()

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo): 
db.students.find({$or: [{home_state: "California"}, {home_state: "Washington"}]})

Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3: 
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})

Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10: 
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive): 
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 1, $lte: 9}})

Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. 
It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation: 
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays: 
db.students.update({_id: ObjectId("60a180f8e85bdf11a0292f09")}, {$push: {interests: "Pool"}})

Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array:
db.students.update({_id: ObjectId("60a18138e85bdf11a0292f0a")}, {$push: {interests: "Taxes"}})

Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added:
db.students.update({_id: ObjectId("60a18138e85bdf11a0292f0a")}, {$pop: {interests: (1)}})

Remove all students who are from California:
db.students.remove({home_state: "California"})

Remove a student by name:
db.students.remove({name: "Joel"})

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE):
db.students.deleteOne({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}})

Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.updateMany({home_state: "Washington"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1}})

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned':
db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {"number_of_belts": "belts_earned"}})

Remove the 'lucky_number' field:
db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {"lucky_number": ""}})

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date:
db.students.updateMany({}, {$currentDate: {updated_on: {$type: "date"}}})
